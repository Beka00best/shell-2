# Okay, this is shell ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

A **Unix shell** is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

# Shell writing can be divided into several steps :

1. Division into lexemes 
2. STANDARD RUNNING OF THE SOFTWARE.
3. Redirecting the input and output.
4. Сonveyor for two programms.
5. Conveyor for the production number.
6. Background mode
7. Change the cd.
8. New &&.
9. Ctrl+c

# I step
Given a string, that is, a sequence of words separated by spaces or tabs. You need to create a dynamic array of pointers to strings, and write a function that reads before spaces and returns a text pointer to the word and the last character.
# II step
It is necessary to run the program in an infinite loop until we meet the word "exit" or "quit"
# III step 
If an input or output character is encountered as a token, you need to make the corresponding input or output to the file
# IV step 
Need to redirect the output of the child process to the standard input of the parent process
