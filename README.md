# Okay, this is shell ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

A **Unix shell** is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

**Shell writing can be divided into several steps **:

1. Division into lexemes 
2. STANDARD RUNNING OF THE SOFTWARE.
3. Redirecting the input and output.
5. Conveyor for the production number.
6. Background mode
7. Change the cd.
8. New &&.
